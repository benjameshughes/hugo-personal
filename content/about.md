# Hello! Nice to meet you
#### I am Ben and I make things

Hello and welcome to my little space on the internet. I am Ben and for over 10 years I have been tinkering, breaking, making, learning, and fixing all sorts of technology and gadgets. For as long as I can remember I have been infatuated with the internet and how computers communicate and "talk" to each other. Even though I know how this works now it is still magic to me, so the fire is still alive!
