# Let's make this fun and easy!

I am all about making my life easier and automating everything! So, instead of having this on my local machine and then manually pushings to my web server... I am going to use GitHub and GitHub actions.

### All it takes is a push

My plan is to make it so that each time I make a new push to a GitHub repo that triggers a bunch of actions to complie Hugo and then push to my webserver. Sounds easy, no? Well it is. People much smarter than me have worked it out and made the software. I just need to give said software instructions on what to do.

**Begin!**
